# PragyaRL

This is the official repository for the PragyaRL algorithm/launcher. The description 
of the folders is as follows:

1. **datasets**: All the datasets are kept here
2. **envs**: All the environments will be here
3. **results**: Any results like plots or saved models should be saved here
4. **utils**: Functions to support the main files

Additionally, the **main.py** file for now is the file being used for training and 
testing the models. Please make a new main file, eg: main_model_test.py, if you
want to run and commit different scripts or different experiments. 

If you are building agents from scratch then make a new folder where all the agent-
related code is stored.
